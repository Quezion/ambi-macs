# ambi-macs

This is my personal setup for the [Ergodox EZ.](https://www.google.com/search?q=ergodoz+e) I use this daily to develop Clojure apps in Emacs. The name is inspired by the term "ambidextrous", which this layout provides via an `alpha-shift` modifier (tranposes all face characters on the left <-> right boards.)

It also contains a "vi leader key" and first class access of ctrl/shift/alt modifiers. These modifiers are also fully functional space cadet shifts for `( )` / `{ }` / `[ ]`. The opening character is on the left side of the shift, and the closing character is on the right. [Reference `keymap.c` for a visual layout.](https://github.com/Quezion/ambi-macs/blob/master/keymap.c#L108)

There's also a media layer with playback controls, volume up/down, and keyboard controls.

I use this layout every day, and while it's significantly more powerful than other offerings (WRT Clojure development), it may be difficult to learn. As of 2017/10/19, no other developer has tried.

I'm willing to assist others in learning, understanding, or extending this layout. Contact me if you're interested.

In the meantime, I'll keep happily clacking along.
